<p><strong>All About Hurricanes...</strong><br></p>

<h1>Hurricane Basics</h1>
<p>A hurricane is a severe tropical cyclone originating in the equatorial regions of the Atlantic Ocean or Caribbean Sea or eastern regions of the Pacific Ocean, traveling north, northwest, or northeast from its point of origin, and usually involving heavy rains. Hurricanes have a wind speed greater than 74 miles (119 kilometers) per hour, according to the Beaufort scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img vspace="10" border="0" class="resizable" longdesc="Hurricane Elena from Sattelite" src="hurricane_elena_from_sattelite.gif" align="left" hspace="20" alt="hurricane_elena_from_sattelite.gif" height="229" width="320"> The ingredients for a hurricane&nbsp; include a pre-existing weather disturbance, warm tropical oceans, moisture, and relatively light winds aloft. If the right conditions persist long enough, they can combine to produce the violent winds, incredible waves, torrential rains, and floods we associate with this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Each year, an average of ten tropical storms develop over the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico. Many of these remain over the ocean. Six of these storms become hurricanes each year. In an average 3-year period, roughly five hurricanes strike the United States coastline, killing approximately 50 to 100 people anywhere from Texas to Maine. Of these, two are typically major hurricanes (winds greater than 110 mph).</p>

<h1>What is a Hurricane?</h1>
<p>A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone, which is a generic term for a low pressure system that generally forms in the tropics. The cyclone is accompanied by thunderstorms and, in the Northern Hemisphere, a counterclockwise circulation of winds near the earth's surface. Tropical cyclones are classified as follows:</p>
<h3>Tropical Depression</h3>
<p>An organized system of clouds and thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds of 38 mph (33 kt) or less</p>
<h3>Tropical Storm</h3>
<p>An organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds of 39-73 mph (34-63 kt)</p>
<h3>Hurricane</h3>
<p>An intense tropical weather system of strong thunderstorms with a well-defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 kt) or higher</p>
<p>Hurricanes are categorized according to the strength of their winds using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. A Category 1 storm has the lowest wind speeds, while a Category 5 hurricane has the strongest. These are relative terms, because lower category storms can sometimes inflict greater damage than higher category storms, depending on where they strike and the particular hazards they bring. In fact, tropical storms can also produce significant damage and loss of life, mainly due to flooding.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Hurricane Structure</h1>
<p>Contrary to how many weather maps appear, a hurricane is more than a point on a weather map, and its path is more than a line. It is a large system that can affect a wide area, requiring that precautions be taken far from where the eye is predicted to come ashore. This section talks about the different parts of the hurricane and will help you better understand hurricane hazards.</p>
<p>The main parts of a hurricane are the rainbands on its outer edges, the eye, and the eyewall. Air spirals in toward the center in a counter-clockwise pattern, and out the top in the opposite direction. In the very center of the storm, air sinks, forming the cloud-free eye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Eye</h3>
<p>The hurricane's center is a relatively calm, clear area usually 20-40 miles across. People in the midst of a hurricane are often amazed at how the incredibly fierce winds and rain can suddenly stop and the sky clear when the eye comes over them. Then, just as quickly, the winds and rain begin again, but this time from the opposite direction.</p>
<h3>The Eyewall</h3>
<p>The dense wall of thunderstorms surrounding the eye has the strongest winds within the storm. Changes in the structure of the eye and eyewall can cause changes in the wind speed, which is an indicator of the storm's intensity. The eye can grow or shrink in size, and double (concentric) eyewalls can form.</p>
<h3>The Spiral Rainbands</h3>
<p>The storm's outer rainbands (often with hurricane or tropical storm-force winds) can extend a few hundred miles from the center. Hurricane Andrew's (1992) rainbands reached only 100 miles out from the eye, while those in Hurricane Gilbert (1988) stretched over 500 miles. These dense bands of thunderstorms, which spiral slowly counterclockwise, range in width from a few miles to tens of miles and are 50 to 300 miles long. Sometimes the bands and the eye are obscured by higher level clouds, making it difficult for forecasters to use satellite imagery to monitor the storm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<h1>Hurricane Size and Movement</h1>
<p>Typical hurricanes are about 300 miles wide although they can vary considerably. Hurricane Andrew (1992), the most devastating hurricane of this century, was a relatively small hurricane. Hurricane-force winds can extend outward to about 25 miles from the storm center of a small hurricane and to more than 150 miles for a large one.</p>
<p>In the northern hemisphere, hurricane winds circulate around the center in a counter-clockwise fashion. This means that the wind direction at your location depends on where the hurricane's eye is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, a hurricane's forward speed averages around 15-20 mph. However, some hurricanes stall, often causing devastatingly heavy rain. Others can accelerate to more than 60 mph. Hurricane Hazel (1954) hit North Carolina on the morning of 15 October; fourteen hours later it reached Toronto, Canada where it caused 80 deaths. Some hurricanes follow a fairly straight course, while others loop and wobble along the path. These seemingly erratic changes are difficult to forecast.</p>

<h1>The Right Side of the Storm</h1>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, the hurricane's right side (relative to the direction it is traveling) is the most dangerous part of the storm because of the additive effect of the hurricane wind speed and speed of the larger atmospheric flow (the steering winds). The increased winds on the right side increase the storm surge. Tornadoes are also more common on this side.<img vspace="10" border="0" class="resizable" src="right_side_hurricane2.gif" align="left" hspace="20" alt="right_side_hurricane2.gif" height="250" width="300"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the figure to the left, pretend you are standing behind the hurricane with your back to the steering flow. In this case, the right side is the eastern section of the hurricane. (If it were traveling east to west, the right side would be the north section.) The winds around the hurricane's eye are moving in a counterclockwise fashion.</p>
<p>At Point A, the hurricane winds are nearly in line with the steering wind, adding to the strength of the winds. For example, if the steering currents are 30 mph and the average hurricane winds are 100 mph, the wind speed would be 130 mph at Point A. On the other hand, the winds at Point B are moving opposite those of the steering wind and therefore slow to 70 mph (100 - 30 mph). Incidentally, NHC forecasts take this effect into account in their official wind estimates.</p>
<p>Surface winds around a hurricane rotate counterclockwise and inward. The winds contribute to forming the mound of water that eventually becomes a hurricane's storm surge.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<h3>What is a Hurricane?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A &quot;hurricane&quot; is the most severe category of the meteorological phenomenon known as the &quot;tropical cyclone.&quot;</li>
<li>Tropical cyclones are low pressure systems that have thunderstorm activity and rotate counterclockwise. A tropical cyclone that has winds of 38 mph (33 kt) or less is called a tropical depression. When the tropical cyclone's winds reach 39-73 mph (34-63 kt), it is called a tropical storm. When the winds exceed 74 mph (64 kt), the storm is considered to be a hurricane.</li>
<li>The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale defines hurricane strength by categories. A Category 1 storm is the weakest hurricane (winds 74-95 mph or 64-82 kt); a Category 5 hurricane is the strongest (winds greater than 155 mph or 135 kt).</li>
<li>The category of the storm does not necessarily relate directly to the damage it will inflict. Lower category storms (and even tropical storms) can cause substantial damage depending on what other weather features they interact with, where they strike, and how slow they move.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hurricane Formation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The formation of a tropical cyclone and its growth into a hurricane requires: 1) a pre-existing weather disturbance; 2) ocean temperatures at least 80&#186;F to a depth of about 150 feet; and 3) winds that are relatively light throughout the depth of the atmosphere (low wind shear).</li>
<li>Tropical storms and hurricanes weaken when their sources of heat and moisture are cut off (such as happens when they move over land) or when they encounter strong wind shear.</li>
<li>A weakening hurricane can reintensify if it moves into a more favorable region. The remnants of a land falling hurricane can still cause considerable damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anatomy of a Hurricane</h3>
<ul>
<li>Typical hurricanes are about 300 miles wide although they can vary considerably in size.</li>
<li>The eye at a hurricane's center is a relatively calm, clear area approximately 20-40 miles across.</li>
<li>The eyewall surrounding the eye is composed of dense clouds that contain the highest winds in the storm.</li>
<li>The storm's outer rainbands (often with hurricane or tropical storm-force winds) are made up of dense bands of thunderstorms ranging from a few miles to tens of miles wide and 50 to 300 miles long.</li>
<li>Hurricane-force winds can extend outward to about 25 miles in a small hurricane and to more than 150 miles for a large one. Tropical storm-force winds can stretch out as far as 300 miles from the center of a large hurricane.</li>
<li>Frequently, the right side of a hurricane is the most dangerous in terms of storm surge, winds, and tornadoes.</li>
<li>A hurricane's speed and path depend on complex ocean and atmospheric interactions, including the presence or absence of other weather patterns. This complexity of the flow makes it very difficult to predict the speed and direction of a hurricane.</li>
<li>Do not focus on the eye or the track&#8211;hurricanes are immense systems that can move in complex patterns that are difficult to predict. Be prepared for changes in size, intensity, speed, and direction.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Tropical Cyclones are Observed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Direct measurements of tropical storm and hurricane dimensions and wind speeds are taken primarily by reconnaissance aircraft, although ships and buoys also take important measurements. Once a hurricane is near and/or on land, Automated Surface Observation Systems (ASOS) provide surface conditions, and radiosondes take upper air measurements.</li>
<li>Indirect observational methods include satellite imagery and Doppler radar. In particular, satellites have greatly improved our ability to monitor and understand hurricanes. Radar data are important once the storm comes close to shore and after landfall.</li>
